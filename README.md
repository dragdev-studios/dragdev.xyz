## Contributions
Due to new advancements in ~dragdev technology~, you can now contribute visually in two ways:
* Markdown (.md files)
* HTML (.html files)

This means edits to our site are even more accessible!

If you're contributing HTML:
1. Ensure your style matches that of index.html
2. Ensure your \<head\> contains plenty of meta tags to assist SEO and allow for embedding
3. Try to keep page loading times to a minimum.
4. Plain javascript only. This means no jquery.

If you're contributing MarkDown:
1. Just make it look good to be honest.
2. Take note all HTML tags within a markdown file are cleaned on parsing.
